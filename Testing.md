Unit Tests using JEST
File Naming:

Unit test files should follow the naming convention: ComponentName.test.js.
Example: MyComponent.test.js
Test Structure:

Structure your tests to cover different aspects of the component's functionality.
Use describe and it to group and define test cases.
Assertions:

Use Jest's expect function for assertions.

Example:

test('it should render without errors', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('some-element')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
Integration Tests
File Naming:

Integration test files should follow the naming convention: ComponentIntegration.test.js.
Example: MyComponentIntegration.test.js
Test Structure:

Test the interaction between multiple components or features.
Assertions:

Similar to unit tests, use assertions to check if components work together as expected.
Testing Asynchronous Code
Mocking:
Use Jest's mocking capabilities to simulate asynchronous behavior.

Example:

test('it should fetch data and render', async () => {
  jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch').mockResolvedValueOnce({ json: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: 'mocked data' }) });

  render(<MyComponent />);
  // Your assertions here

  // Reset the mock after the test
  global.fetch.mockClear();
});
Running Tests
Run All Tests:

Execute all tests with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This will run Jest in watch mode, allowing you to interactively re-run tests as you make changes.

Coverage:

Generate test coverage reports:

bash
Copy code
npm test -- --coverage
Open coverage/lcov-report/index.html in your browser to view the coverage report.
